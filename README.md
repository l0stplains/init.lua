# l0stplains's init.lua

This repository contains my personal Neovim configuration, plugin managed with [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim).

## How to Use

1. **Clone** this repository into your Neovim config folder (usually `~/.config/nvim`).
2. **Open Neovim** and plugin installation will be automatically handled by `lazy.nvim`.  
3. **Explore** the directory structure (`ftplugin/`, `plugin/`, etc.) to see how everything is organized.

Feel free to adjust or extend these configs to fit your workflow.
